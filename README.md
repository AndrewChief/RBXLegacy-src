#RBXLegacy
----------------------------------
========= CREATOR'S NOTE =========
----------------------------------

4-5 days didn't go to waste, didn't it?

Made this little thing to mess around with Lua and RBXPri stuff. Instructions and legal info are in the README.txt in the client itself.

Download the actual client at http://gamejolt.com/games/rbxlegacy/195327 or download the source code as a zip.

Have fun!

This also includes the bonus client, REBX2008 with its launcher source.
